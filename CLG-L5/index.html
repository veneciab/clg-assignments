    <h1>Bittersweet Quiz<sup>*</sup></h1>
      <div class="section-1">
        <p>Some of us inhabit the bittersweet state instinctively, always have.</p>

        <p>Whilst some of us avoid it as much as we can.</p>

        <p>Some of us arrive there when we reach a certain age, or after facing life’s trials and triumphs.</p>

        <p>If you’re wondering how inclined you are to this sensibility, you can take this quiz.</p>

        <p>To find out how bittersweet you are, at this particular moment in time, indicate your level of agreement on a scale from 0 <em>(not at all)</em> to 10 <em>(completely)</em>.</p>
