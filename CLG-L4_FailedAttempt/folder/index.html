    <p>Director and animator Pete Docter of the widely acclaimed Pixar animated feature, <em>Inside Out</em>, additionally came to realise (and susbequently, made it the premise of the Oscar winning film <strong>and</strong> highest grossing original film in Pixar history), that <del>joy</del> <ins>sadness</ins>, connects people together. <strong>Sadness, of all the emotions triggers compassion.</strong><sup>2</sup></p>

  <p class="Keltner">Professor psychology, Dacher Keltner, also found through his research that when we witness suffering, <strong>our vagus nerve makes us care.</strong> When we experience sadness, <em>we share a common suffering</em> - it is one of the few times when people allow themselves to be  truly vulnerable.</p>
